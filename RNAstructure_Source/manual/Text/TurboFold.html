# IMPORTANT CONFIG FILE FORMAT NOTES:
#
# Config file options described below are <b>not</b> case sensitive.
#
# Option lines may be specified by the option name followed by an equals sign and the option's desired value.
# When specifying an option, there may be nothing else on the line.
# &lt;option&gt; = &lt;value&gt;
#
# Specifying comment lines:
# Comment lines must begin with "#" followed by a space.
# There may not be more than one "#" in a comment line.
# However, a comment line may be an unbroken string of "#", as in a divider between sets of options.
#
# Blank lines are skipped.

# Input options
################################################################

# Mode specifies the resolving algorithm TurboFold uses after its initial fold.
# A valid mode is required for TurboFold to run properly.
# Valid modes can be one of three options:
#       1. MEA (Maximum expected accuracy)
#       2. ProbKnot (For pseudoknotted sequences)
#       3. Threshold (Finding most probable pairs)
# Modes should be specified as text strings: MEA, ProbKnot, or Threshold.
# The default mode is MEA.
Mode = &lt;mode specification&gt;

# There are two separate ways to specify a group of input sequences:
# 1. Place sequence file names in brackets separated by semicolons.
#    Note that there cannot be any spaces whatsoever between the brackets.
#    The list must hold "SequenceNumber" sequences.
# 2. Each successive sequence &quot;n&quot; from 1 to SequenceNumber is specified as &quot;Seq&lt;n&gt;.&quot;
#    Note that there cannot be any spaces in the file name.
InSeq = {seq1;seq2;seq3;}
Seq&lt;n&gt; = &lt;seq file n&gt;

# There are two separate ways to specify a group of output CT files:
# 1. Place CT file names in brackets separated by semicolons.
#    Note that there cannot be any spaces whatsoever between the brackets.
#    The list must hold "SequenceNumber" CT files.
# 2. Each successive CT file &quot;n&quot; from 1 to SequenceNumber is specified as &quot;CT&lt;n&gt;.&quot;
#    Note that there cannot be any spaces in the file name.
OutCT = {ct1;ct2;ct3;}
CT&lt;n&gt; = &lt;ct file n&gt;

# SequenceNumber specifies the number of sequences given for calculation.
# This is only needed if both sequences and CT files are specified individually.
SequenceNumber = &lt;number of sequences&gt;

# Note that sequence file, CT file, and sequence number options must appear in one of two valid combinations, depending if files are
# specified singly or in a group.
#
# Singly:
# Mode = &lt;mode&gt;
# SequenceNumber = &lt;n&gt;
# Seq1 = &lt;seq file 1&gt;
# CT1 = &lt;ct file n&gt;
# ... repeat single entries of Seq and CT until &lt;n&gt; is reached
#
# Groups:
# Mode = &lt;mode&gt;
# InSeq = {seq1;seq2;seq3;}
# OutCT = {ct1;ct2;ct3;}

# Save&lt;1&gt; - Save&lt;SequenceNumber&gt; specifies the partiton function save file names to be outputted for each successive sequence &quot;n&quot;
# from 1 to SequenceNumber.
# Note that there cannot be any spaces in the file name.
# Save files are not required for any sequence.
Save&lt;n&gt; = &lt;save file n&gt;

# SHAPE&lt;1&gt; - SHAPE&lt;SequenceNumber&gt; specifies the SHAPE file names for each successive sequence &quot;n&quot;
# from 1 to SequenceNumber.
# SHAPE files are not required for any sequence.
# Note that there cannot be any spaces in the file name.
SHAPE&lt;n&gt; = &lt;SHAPE file n&gt;

# TurboFold options
################################################################

# Note that TurboFold options affect output regardless of the mode specified.

# Gamma specifies the TurboFold gamma value.
# This should not be confused with MeaGamma (below).
# Its default value is 0.3.
Gamma = 0.3

# Iterations specifies the number of iterations TurboFold goes through.
# This should not be confused with PkIterations (below).
# Its default value is 3.
Iterations = 3

# MaximumPairingDistance specified the maximum distance between nucleotides that can pair.
# i.e. for nucleotide i to pair with j, [i - j| &lt; MaximumPairingDistance.
# This applies to each sequence.
# Its default is no limit, which is indicated by a value of zero.
MaximumPairingDistance = 0

# SHAPEintercept specifies the SHAPE intercept used by TurboFold.
# Note that if specified, this value is only used if one or more SHAPE files is also specified.
# Its default value is -0.6 kcal/mol.
SHAPEintercept = -0.6

# SHAPEslope specifies the SHAPE slope used by TurboFold.
# Note that if specified, this value is only used if one or more SHAPE files is also specified.
# Its default value is 1.8 kcal/mol.
SHAPEslope = 1.8

# Temperature specifies the temperature at which TurboFold is run, in Kelvin.
# Its default value is 310.15 K, which is 37 degrees C.
Temperature = 310.15

# Processors specifies the number of processors TurboFold is run on.
# Note that this flag only has an effect when TurboFold-smp, the parallel version of TurboFold, is run.
# Its default value is 1.
Processors = 1

################################################################
# Maximum expected accuracy (MEA) mode options
################################################################

# Note that the following options only have an effect when MEA mode is specified. 
# If they are specified when TurboFold is in a different mode, they are ignored.

# MaxPercent specifies the maximum percent energy difference.
# Its default value is 50 (percent).
MaxPercent = 50

# MaxStructures specifies the maximum number of structures to calculate.
# Its default value is 1000 structures.
MaxStructures = 1000

# MeaGamma specifies the MEA mode gamma value.
# This should not be confused with Gamma (above).
# Its default value is 1.0.
MeaGamma = 1.0

# Window specifies the window size.
# Its default value is 5 nucleotides.
Window = 5

################################################################
# Pseudoknot (ProbKnot) mode options
################################################################

# Note that the following options only have an effect when ProbKnot mode is specified. 
# If they are specified when TurboFold is in a different mode, they are ignored.

# MinHelixLength is the minimum helix length allowed during folding.
# Its default value is 3 nucleotides.
MinHelixLength = 3

# Iterations specifies the number of iterations ProbKnot goes through.
# This should not be confused with Iterations (above).
# Its default value is 1.
PkIterations = 1

################################################################
# Probable Pairs (Threshold) mode options
################################################################

# Note that the following options only have an effect when Threshold mode is specified. 
# If they are specified when TurboFold is in a different mode, they are ignored.

# Threshold specifies the probability threshold at which pairs are included in a structure.
# If a threshold is explicitly specified, it should be expressed as a number &gt;= 0.5 and &lt;= 1.0.
# Its default value is 0.
# This signifies that structures should be generated at the following thresholds:
#       &gt;= 0.99, &gt;= 0.97, &gt;= 0.95, &gt;= 0.90, &gt;= 0.80, &gt;= 0.70, &gt;= 0.60, &gt;= 0.50
Threshold: 0
