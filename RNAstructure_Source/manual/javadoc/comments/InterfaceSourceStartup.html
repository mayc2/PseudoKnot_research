A package that holds all Java RNAstructure interface classes that are directly called at the Java interface startup.
<br/><br>
The RNAstructureBackendCalculator classes are generated by SWIG, and connect the C++ back end to the Java front end.
Neither of those classes are commented.
This is because the SWIG documentation framework is deprecated, and no changes have been made to the generated files, for the sake of clarity and simplicity.
To see the documentation of the C++ classes that back these Java classes (they have the same name as the Java classes), please see the Doxygen documentation for them.
